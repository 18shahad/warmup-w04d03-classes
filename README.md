# Shops!

Create a class Shop that can help shop owners keep track of their products!

Our class should have multiple functionality:

- initialize your shop with a random ID.
---
- add_product
    should take the name, price and stock of your product. Stock should be optional otherwise it counts as 1.

---

- sale
    should print out new prices for all your products based on the percentage you pass 
    ```ruby
    sale(50) #applies a 50% sale
    ```

---
- stock
    show the stock of your products
---
- purchase
    should take the name and amount of the purchased item. Then subtracts the amount of items you purchase from your stock, if your stock is empty, it gives a warning.
---
- show_products
